# Buttered
A python script to execute commands in your terminal of choice, all in one simple program.<br/>

# How does it work?
Buttered works by making a launcher (for either MacOS's Terminal or Windows Command Prompt) that makes a simple wrapper for running your commands without needing to find those pesky apps anyway!<br/>
It functions as a form of **terminal emulator / terminal application**, meaning it isn't a full replacement for your terminal needs, but is *very* useful if you are using a device that meets the following criteria:
  1. Your device is controlled by someone or something, whether that be a system administrator or your friend.
  2. You somehow misplaced your terminal and need an easy way to use it.
If you meet those criteria, then you are ***probably*** one of many users who find this helpful.

# How do I use it?
Buttered is as simple as opening the program (inside your chosen python IDE, or else it will not work) and waiting for the '|' symbol to show up. You may then type whatever command you wish.

## What happens if the command fails?
Buttered will run the function again. Simple and easy, but is a little but of a duck tape fix.

## What is the main purpose of this?
To allow users (who probably couldn't beforehand) to have access to your operating system's terminal (or command prompt). This also works very well with items that require commands such as accessing 'ssh ssh.chat'.
